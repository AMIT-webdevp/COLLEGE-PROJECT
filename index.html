    <h2 class="desc"desc>MOUNTAIN BIKING</h2>
</div>
<p class="text">
    Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, usually using specially
     designed mountain bikes Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate features
      designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain, such as air or coil-sprung shocks
       used as suspension, larger and wider wheels and tires, stronger frame materials, and mechanically or
        hydraulically actuated disc brakes. Mountain biking can generally be broken down into five distinct 
        categories: cross country, trail riding, all mountain (also referred to as "Enduro"), downhill, and freeride.
    <br> <br>
    This sport requires endurance, core and back strength, balance, bike handling skills, and self-reliance.
     Advanced riders pursue both steep technical descents and high-incline climbs. In the case of freeride, 
     downhill, and dirt jumping, 
    aerial maneuvers are performed off both natural features and specially constructed jumps and ramps.

    <h2 class="desc"desc>PARAGLIDING </h2>
</div>
<p class="text">
    Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, 
    free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a 
    harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the
     suspension lines, the pressure of air 
    entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.
    <br> <br>
    Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of
     kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm.
      By skillful exploitation
     of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

    <h2 class="desc"desc>SURFING</h2>
</div>
<p class="text">
    Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a 
    board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the
     surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also 
     be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
    <br> <br>
    Three major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are stand-up paddling, long boarding and short boarding
     with several major
     differences including the board design and length, the riding style and the kind of wave that is ridden.
